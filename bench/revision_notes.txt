# File for adding notes to code revisions.
# This is used for displaying annotations to Skia benchmark dashboards.
#
# The format of each data line (non-empty, not started with "#") is:
# <Revision_Number>:<Annotations_To_Display>
# Where <Revision_Number> must be an integer. Anything else in this line
# after ":" will be displayed as annotation for the corresponding revision.
#
# Unrecognized data lines (not start with an integer followed by ":") will be
# ignored on the dashboard side.
# Please have changes reviewed by teammates so people understand and agree on
# them.

# For testing only. TODO(bensong): remove this once testing is done.
